## Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hey there! I'm Ben, a 24-year-old career changer who has hung up his corporate shoes in search of a new challenge. After five years in sales, it was time to shake things up. Taking some time to work as a gardener and recalibrating my goals, I was persuaded by a close friend to dip my toes into the world of software development, which captivated my interest. So here I am, enthusiastic and eager to continue growing as a Full Stack Web Developer.

Starting in February 2024, I have undertaken a three-month internship at Datacom, Auckland, alongside several other candidates from Mission Ready as part of my Certificate in Applied Technology Product Solutions (Level 6 - NZQA accredited). My team has been tasked with developing an enterprise web application which we hope to release for production in April 2024.
